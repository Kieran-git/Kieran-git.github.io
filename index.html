                    <br></br>
                    I'm Kieran and I am currently studying Software Engineering at University for my bachelors
                    degree, I also intend to
                    continue my study for a masters qualification in the same or similar relevance
                    field of study.
                    <br></br>
                    Regarding what type of developer I am: I like to work towards deadlines as this allows me to
                    plan the workload accordingly to make sure that the development process is as smooth as possible,
                    ultimately
                    allowing the project to be finished in time.
                    <br></br>
                    I mainly specialise in web development which includes both
                    back-end server side logic as well as front end design and client side logic. However, I'm also well
                    versed in desktop
                    application development and can adapt most web solutions to a desktop application or vise versa if
                    required.
                    <br><br>
                    I have also recently taken an interest in more specific and complex fields of study such as data
                    science, AI and
                    machine
                    learning. I have taken a few courses in these areas including the Microsoft Azure AI Fundamentals
                    course in
                    order to gather as much information as possible and decide if I want to specialise in this for my
                    dissertation.

                    As shown below here are some of the main technologies/languages that I am experienced in.
                    Furthermore, I am especially
                    profficent in both PHP and C# as my main two languages. I am also versed in related
